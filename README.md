## üöÄ Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version >= 21.0.0)
- npm
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)
- A football-data.org API key

### Setup

For a streamlined setup, you can use the provided setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will:

- Check Node.js version
- Install dependencies
- Set up git hooks
- Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` (if it doesn't exist)
- Run initial code quality checks and a test build

Alternatively, you can follow the manual steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fcb
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Add your football-data.org API key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run netlify-dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`.

## üì¶ Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
